## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

The bot first starts to fill the database. Content of the database updates in 90 seconds according to exchanges' API data. Then, in every 2 seconds bot checks for a new message from the user. If there is a new message, bot reads the command from the user and if it is a valid coin symbol, makes a query to the database and returns the corresponding data to user.

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the bot:

Enter the coin symbol without slash or something i.e. "eth" (without quotes, case doesn't matter). And bot replies you with information. Because of some coins are not present in all exchanges, only the exchanges that has specific coin shows up in bot's reply.
